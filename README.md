# Portfolio (React + Tailwind)

This is a starter portfolio built with Vite, React and Tailwind CSS.

Features
- Responsive layout
- Smooth navigation (anchor links + CSS scroll-behavior)
- Project showcase with image gallery modal
- About section with profile image
- Contact form (Formspree placeholder) â€” replace with your endpoint
- SEO-friendly meta tags and semantic markup

Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes
- Replace `/public/profile.svg` with your professional photo (prefer a compressed JPEG/WebP).
- Update the contact form action in `src/components/Contact.jsx` to point to your form backend (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or your own API).
- For better SEO and performance, consider adding server-side rendering or prerendering for the production build.
